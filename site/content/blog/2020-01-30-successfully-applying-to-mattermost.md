Given our open-source culture, remote-first work environment, and [Series A](https://mattermost.com/blog/mattermost-raises-20m-series-a-funding/) and [Series B](https://mattermost.com/blog/yc-leads-50m-series-b-in-mattermost-as-open-source-slack-alternative/) funding announcements, it should come as no surprise that Mattermost is a popular place to work. While our [hiring process](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/developer.html#hiring-process) is fairly well documented, it may not be obvious how to succeed at it. As one of several engineering hiring managers, I've reviewed many candidates and have strong opinions on what makes a successful application.

While the following is specific to applying to an engineering role at Mattermost, there's undoubtedly overlap with other roles.

### Carefully answer the application questions

One of the biggest challenges in dealing with large numbers of applications is deciding which ones deserve further scrutiny. Towards that end, we currently ask the following questions when you apply to an engineering position:
1. Why are you applying for this position at Mattermost (other than it being a remote position)?
2. On a scale of 1 (not a fit) to 10 (perfect fit), how would you rate your potential fit with the role for which you're applying?
3. Please tell us why you selected such a rating?
4. What's one of the most challenging problems you've had to solve?
5. Have you used Mattermost previously or contributed to the open source project? If so, please let us know the ways you have been involved.

Besides the specific facts that you share, your answers to these questions tell us a number of other useful things:
* Do you communicate well in written form?
* Do you have a realistic perspective on your own experience and skill set?
* Do you take open-source seriously?

To my continued surprise, we get a non-trivial number of "spam" applications: blank or single-word answers and scoring a 10 on fit. To stand out, you don't need to write a half-dozen paragraphs, but you do need to put yourself in the shoes of the hiring manager. Do your answers evidence careful thought and investigation? Do your answers reflect relevant personal experience? Are your sentences grammatically correct?

### Create an account on [community.mattermost.com](https://community.mattermost.com/)

The last question above starts with "Have you used Mattermost previously..." You should always be able to answer this with a "Yes!" because you can create an account at https://community.mattermost.com/ and immediately start chatting with any one of our staff members or community contributors. Consider hanging out for a few days prior to your application, joining some discussions and making some connections. Then share your username with us during the application, and maybe the hiring manager will already recognize you!

Of course, if you've previously used Mattermost in some other context, definitely share that experience too. Don't feel the need to flatter us: I don't mind hearing about what you liked, but I'm much more interested in what you didn't like, why it caused you trouble, and how you might have worked around the problem. It's also fine to compare us to Slack or Microsoft Teams (for better or worse) -- I promise not to take offence!

### Highlight any open-source experience

The last question above also ends with "... or contributed to the open source project?" While we appreciate all open-source efforts, let me be upfront and say that posting the implementations to your school assignments doesn't usually grab our attention.  We make it really easy to [start contributing](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/) to Mattermost, and intentionally create [Good First Issue](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+archived%3Afalse+org%3Amattermost+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22++label%3A%22Up+For+Grabs%22++label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22) tickets to help newcomers to open-source get started. GitHub recently made it even easier to [find ways to start contributing](https://github.blog/2020-01-22-browse-good-first-issues-to-start-contributing-to-open-source/) to open-source projects. Find something you're passionate about and make a difference, then answer this question with a "Yes," and link to one or more of your pull requests.

While we may still consider your application even if you don't have time to contribute up front, the ones that do are almost always fast tracked through to a technical interview.

### "Be Smart and Get Stuff Done"

Whether contributing before your application, interviewing with a staff member, or showcasing your talent in our paid simulation process, keep in mind the kind of candidate Mattermost wants to hire: someone who is "smart and gets stuff done."
